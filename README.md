# Lobby Improvements
Adds several quality of life improvements to the lobby UI.
- A lobby code panel which generates a code for players to join with (along with support for streamer's hiding of it)
- A system to restrict invites to solely the host
- A kick panel for hosts, to kick players from the lobby.
